    "*“In another thirty years people will laugh at anyone who tries to invent a language without closures, just as they'll laugh now at anyone who tries to invent a language without recursion.”*\n",

    "What you'll learn in this chapter:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The logic behind MiniMax tree search\n",
    "* Understanding recursion and applying it in MiniMax tree search\n",
    "* Implementing MiniMax tree search in the coin game\n",
    "* Testing the effectiveness of the MiniMax agent\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chapters 2 and 3, you learned how to use look-ahead search to design\n",
    "intelligent game strategies in Tic Tac Toe and Connect Four. However,\n",
    "the search process was hard coded. If we look ahead beyond three steps,\n",
    "the coding becomes tedious and error-prone. You may wonder if there is a\n",
    "systematic and more efficient way of conducting look-ahead search. The\n",
    "answer is yes: MiniMax tree search does exactly that. The MiniMax\n",
    "algorithm is a decision rule in artificial intelligence and game theory.\n",
    "The algorithm assumes that each player in the game makes the best\n",
    "possible decisions at each step. Further, each player knows that other\n",
    "players make fully rational decisions as well, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you'll learn to implement MiniMax tree search in the\n",
    "coin game. Specifically, you'll use recursion to call a function inside\n",
    "the function itself. This creates an infinite loop: all command lines in\n",
    "the function are executed iteration after iteration until a certain\n",
    "condition is met. The recursive algorithm allows the MiniMax agent to search ahead\n",
    "until the end of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll create a MiniMax agent in the coin game by using the game environment that we developed in\n",
    "Chapter 1. The algorithm makes hypothetical future moves and exhausts all\n",
    "possible future game paths. The algorithm then uses backward induction\n",
    "to calculate the best move in each step of the game. The MiniMax agent\n",
    "solves the coin game and plays perfectly: it always wins when it pays\n",
    "second. The MiniMax agent makes moves very quickly as well: each move\n",
    "takes a fraction of a second.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this chapter, you'll understand the logic behind MiniMax tree\n",
    "search and be able to design game strategies for any game based on the\n",
    "algorithm. You'll apply the algorithm to Tic Tac Toe and Connect Four as\n",
    "well in the next few chapters and find ways to overcome or mitigate\n",
    "drawbacks associated with MiniMax tree search."
