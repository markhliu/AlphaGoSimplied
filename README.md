# AlphaGo Simplified: Ruled-Based AI and Deep Learning in Everyday Games

Dive into the exciting world of artificial intelligence through the thrilling stories of Deep Blue and AlphaGo. These two groundbreaking moments rewrote the history of AI. In 1997, witness the legendary battle between IBM's Deep Blue and Chess champion Gary Kasparov – the moment when machines first triumphed over human intellect in a Chess showdown that captured the world's attention. But here's the twist: Deep Blue was no machine learning marvel; it was powered by traditional rule-based AI, a far cry from the modern AI we know today.

Fast forward 19 years to the electrifying showdown of 2016, where Google DeepMind's AlphaGo took on Go champion Lee Sedol. Once again, AI seized the spotlight, creating a frenzy in the media. But this time, it was a new kind of AI, driven by the incredible force of machine learning, particularly deep reinforcement learning. The strategies it employed were a game-changer, quite literally.

Now, you may be wondering: What is machine learning, and how does it relate to AI? Why is deep learning all the rage in today's tech-driven world? This book has the answers. In these pages, you'll unravel the inner workings of traditional rule-based AI and modern machine learning. I'll show you how to apply these concepts to three simple yet captivating games: Last Coin Standing, Tic Tac Toe, and Connect Four.

Imagine Last Coin Standing as a thrilling duel where players take turns removing coins from a pile of 21. The catch? You can only grab one or two coins at a time, and the one who nabs the last coin emerges victorious. Tic Tac Toe, a timeless classic, pits two players against each other in a quest to form three Xs or Os in a row, be it vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. And then there's Connect Four, where competitors drop discs into columns, vying to create a line of four game pieces either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Why these three games, you ask? Well, they're simple to grasp and perfect for exploring the world of rule-based AI, deep reinforcement learning (e.g., the actor-critic method), and other AI techniques. No need to get tangled in complex game rules. In contrast, games like Chess and Go require a deep well of domain knowledge to devise effective strategies. Chess, for instance, uses thousands of rules to evaluate board positions in Deep Blue's algorithm, and Go involves intricate rules like “no self-capturing”, “komi” (compensation for the first mover's advantage), and the tricky concept of "ko."

What's more, applying rule-based AI and deep learning to these three games is fast and easy and won't drain your computational resources. As you'll discover in this book, you can train game strategies on a regular computer in minutes or hours. As a result, the trained AI provides perfect solutions for the first two games, while Connect Four gets some tough-to-beat strategies. In contrast, Chess and Go require supercomputing facilities. Deep Blue blitzed through hundreds of millions of board positions each second, and AlphaGo gobbled up the processing power of 1920 CPUs and 280 GPUs. The average reader doesn't have access to such supercomputing might, which is why our chosen games make AI learning accessible to everyone with a regular computer.

By immersing yourself in these three captivating games, you'll grasp the essence of rule-based AI, from the MiniMax algorithm to alpha-beta pruning and the exhilarating Monte Carlo Tree Search. Afterward, we'll venture into the realm of Machine Learning, specifically deep reinforcement learning – the secret sauce behind AlphaGo's victory. DeepMind's brilliant minds used the actor-critic method and crafted two deep neural networks to train game strategies.

But that's not all! We'll reveal how to merge deep reinforcement learning with rule-based AI and the power of Monte Carlo Tree Search to supercharge your game strategies (the whole are indeed greater than the sum of its parts in this case), just like the DeepMind team did in the epic AlphaGo showdown. Get ready for an AI journey that's not just educational but downright thrilling.
