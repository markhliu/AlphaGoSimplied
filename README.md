# AlphaGo Simplified: Ruled-Based AI and Deep Learning in Everyday Games

May 11, 1997, was a watershed moment in the history of artificial intelligence (AI): the IBM supercomputer Chess engine, Deep Blue, beat the world Chess champion, Garry Kasparov. It was the first time a machine had triumphed over a human player in a Chess tournament. The news garnered much media attention. But here's the twist: Deep Blue was no machine learning (ML) marvel; it was powered by traditional rule-based AI, a far cry from the modern AI we know today.

Fast forward 19 years to the electrifying showdown of 2016, where Google DeepMind's AlphaGo took on Go champion Lee Sedol. Once again, AI seized the spotlight, creating a frenzy in the media. But this time, it was a new kind of AI, driven by the incredible force of ML, particularly deep reinforcement learning, that captured the world's imagination. The strategies it employed were a game-changer, quite literally. But that's not all! The real secret to AlphaGo’s success is the fact that it merged deep reinforcement learning with rule-based AI such as Monte Carlo Tree Search to supercharge the game strategies (the whole is indeed greater than the sum of its parts in this case). 

Now, you may be wondering: What is ML, and how does it relate to AI? Why is deep learning all the rage in today's tech-driven world? This book has the answers. In these pages, you'll unravel the inner workings of traditional rule-based AI and modern ML. I'll show you how to apply these concepts to three simple yet captivating games: Last Coin Standing, Tic Tac Toe, and Connect Four. You'll dive into the exciting world of artificial intelligence through the thrilling stories of Deep Blue and AlphaGo, two groundbreaking moments that rewrote the history of AI. 

For readers who are unfamiliar with these games, Last Coin Standing (the coin game from now on) is a game in which two players take turns removing one or two coins at a time from a pile of 21 coins. The player who takes the last coin emerges victorious. In Tic Tac Toe, two players take turns marking a cell with an X or O in a three-by-three grid. The first player to connect three Xs or Os in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins. Connect Four pits two players against each other in a quest to form a direct line of four game pieces of the same color. 

Why these three games, you ask? Well, they're simple to grasp and perfect for exploring the world of rule-based AI, deep reinforcement learning (e.g., the actor-critic method), and other AI techniques. No need to get tangled in complex game rules. In contrast, games like Chess and Go require a deep well of domain knowledge to devise effective strategies. Deep Blue's algorithm, for instance, uses thousands of rules to evaluate board positions in Chess. The game of Go involves intricate rules like “no self-capturing”, “komi” (compensation for the first mover's advantage), and the tricky concept of "ko" (avoiding creating a previous board position). What's more, applying rule-based AI and deep learning to these three games is fast and easy and doesn't require costly computational resources. As you'll discover in this book, you can train intelligent game strategies on a regular computer in minutes or hours. As a result, the trained AI provides perfect solutions for the first two games, while Connect Four gets some tough-to-beat strategies. In contrast, Chess and Go require supercomputing facilities. Deep Blue blitzed through hundreds of millions of board positions each second, and AlphaGo gobbled up the processing power of 1920 CPUs and 280 GPUs. The average reader doesn't have access to such supercomputing might, which is why we choose everyday simple games to make AI learning accessible to everyone with a regular computer.

By immersing yourself in these three captivating games, you'll grasp the essence of rule-based AI, from the MiniMax algorithm to alpha-beta pruning and the exhilarating Monte Carlo Tree Search. Afterward, we'll venture into the realm of ML, specifically deep reinforcement learning – the secret sauce behind AlphaGo's victory. DeepMind's brilliant minds used the actor-critic method and crafted two deep neural networks to train game strategies. You’ll learn how to combine modern ML techniques with rule-based AI to achieve superhuman performance, just like the DeepMind team did in the epic AlphaGo showdown. Get ready for an AI journey that's not just educational but downright thrilling.
