    "# Chapter 6: Alpha-Beta Pruning\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from Chapter 5, the minimax algorithm takes too long to make a move even with depth pruning. In this chapter, you'll use alpha beta pruning to save time by not searching certain branches that cannot possibly influence the final game outcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "To implement alpha-beta pruning, we keep track of two numbers: alpha and beta, the best outcome so far for players 1 and 2, respectively. Whenever we have alpha>-beta, or equivalently beta>-alpha, the minimax algorithm stop search a branch. \n",
    "\n",
    "We implement alpha-beta pruning in both Tic Tac Toe and Connect Four in this chapter. We show that the outcomes are the same with and without alpha-beta pruning. We also show that alpha-beta pruning saves significant amount of time for the player to find optimal moves. For example, in Tic Tac Toe, the amount of time for the minimax agent to come up with the first move decreases from 29 seconds without alpha-beta pruning to 1.6 seconds with alpha-beta pruning, a 94% reduction in the amount of time the minimax agent needs to come up with a move.
